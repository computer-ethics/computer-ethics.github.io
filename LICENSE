Title          : Artificial intelligence, artwork
Caption        : Artificial intelligence, conceptual computer artwork. Human hand (right) touching fingers with a robot's hand (left), mimicking Michelangelo's painting The Creation of Adam (in the Sistine Chapel, Rome, Italy) where two pointing hands meeting signify the biblical story of the creation of Adam by God. This image could symbolise humans creating robots.
